xu4 Todo List & Roadmap

Bugs
====

[ ] Pit/Rock traps shaking should be confined to main view.
[ ] Have seen "<player> is Killed!" printed twice (was fighting two enemies).
[ ] HQX filter does not work at 5x scale.
[ ] Font colors are incorrect with SDL backend.


1. Cleanup & Modernize Backend
==============================
This will cleanup the code and start down the path to GPU rendering.

[X] Cleanup backends.
[X]    Drop iOS due to lack of developer support.
[X] Remove indexed (CLUT) images.
[X]    Re-implement text coloration.
[X]    Re-implement dungeon color remapping.
[X] Create Allegro 5 backend.
[/] Create GameServices.
[/]    Collect globals into struct.
[ ]    Init/free modules in consistent manner.
[X] Fix all memory leaks.
[ ] Update SDL to v2.
[ ]    Implement loadBitmapPng
[ ]    Implement equivalent of al_fopen_slice


2. Refactor Config to be more Data Oriented
===========================================
This will hide the configuration storage format to allow alternate
storage backends and simplify data access.

[X] Replace uses of ConfigElement with Config methods that return
    data (raw structures if possible).
[-] Allow game to run by just placing binary in GOG Ultima 4 directory.
[/] Create xu4 package backend (game modules).
[X]   Create pack-xu4 tool.
[ ]   Package overlay.


3. Rendering with GPU
=====================
Accelerate drawing and support 3D scenes & models.

[X] Create OpenGL context and shader.
[/] Convert raster blits to GPU primitive lists.
[/] Separate map rendering from objects (sprites).
[ ] Render 3D models.


4. Toolset for Extended Journeys
================================

[ ] Map editor
[ ] NPC editor
[ ] Item editor (new equipment)
[ ] Zone editor (path following)
[ ] Composer/Animation editor (titles)


5. Emulate Ulitma V
===================
The game data is similar to U4, so this shouldn't be too hard.

[ ] Load maps & graphics.
[ ] Render graphics properly.
[ ] Implement character behavior.
