xu4 Todo List & Roadmap

Bugs
====

[ ] Cannot exit when sleep! effect on party (sleep disables input).
[ ] cmake must be run twice on Fedora 33 before it spits out a Makefile.
    (Or better yet, just ditch cmake)
[ ] Implement trap detection.  Pit/Rock traps can appear 0.5-3.0 seconds
    after the player has moved or turned.


1. Cleanup & Modernize Backend
==============================
This will cleanup the code and start down the path to GPU rendering.

[/] Cleanup backends.
[X]    Drop iOS due to lack of developer support.
[/] Remove indexed (CLUT) images.
[ ]    Re-implement text coloration.
[ ]    Re-implement dungeon color remapping.

[/] Create GameServices.
[/]    Collect globals into struct.
[ ]    Init/free modules in consistent manner.
[X] Fix all memory leaks.


2. Refactor Config to be more Data Oriented
===========================================
This will hide the configuration storage format to allow alternate
storage backends and simplify data access.

[X] Replace uses of ConfigElement with Config methods that return
    data (raw structures if possible).
[ ] Allow game to run by just placing binary in GOG Ultima 4 directory.
[ ] Create xu4 binary package backend.
[.]   Create pack-xu4 tool.


3. Rendering with GPU
=====================
Accelerate drawing and support 3D scenes & models.

[X] Create OpenGL context and shader.
[ ] Convert raster blits to GPU primitive lists.
[ ] Render 3D models.


4. Toolset for Extended Journeys
================================

[ ] Map editor
[ ] NPC editor
[ ] Item editor (new equipment)
[ ] Zone editor (path following)


5. Emulate Ulitma V
===================
The game data is similar to U4, so this shouldn't be too hard.

[ ] Load maps & graphics.
[ ] Render graphics properly.
[ ] Implement character behavior.
