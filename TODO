Bugs
====

[ ] Cannot exit when sleep! effect on party (sleep disables input).
[ ] cmake must be run twice on Fedora 33 before it spits out a Makefile.


1. Cleanup & Modernize Backend
==============================
This will cleanup the code and start down the path to GPU rendering.

[ ] Cleanup backends
[X]    Drop iOS due to lack of developer support.
[/] Remove indexed (CLUT) images
[X] Create Allegro 5 backend
[/] Create GameServices
[/]    Collect globals into struct
[ ]    Init/free modules in consistent manner


2. Refactor Config to be more Data Oriented

This will hide the configuration storage format to allow alternate
storage backends and simplify data access.

[ ] Replace uses of ConfigElement with Config methods that return
    data (raw structures if possible).
[ ] Create Boron backend


3. Make the engine a 2D/3D hybrid
=================================

[ ] Convert raster blits to GPU primitive lists.
