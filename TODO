1. Cleanup & Modernize Backend
==============================
This will cleanup the code and start down the path to GPU rendering.

[X] Cleanup backends.
[X]    Drop iOS due to lack of developer support.
[X] Remove indexed (CLUT) images.
[X]    Re-implement text coloration.
[X]    Re-implement dungeon color remapping.

2. Refactor Config to be more Data Oriented
===========================================

3. Rendering with GPU
=====================
Accelerate drawing and support 3D scenes & models.

[/] Separate map rendering from objects (sprites).
[ ] Render 3D models.


4. Toolset for Extended Journeys
================================

[ ] Map editor
[ ] NPC editor
[ ] Item editor (new equipment)
[ ] Zone editor (path following)
[ ] Composer/Animation editor (titles)


5. Emulate Ulitma V
===================
The game data is similar to U4, so this shouldn't be too hard.
